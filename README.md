# Equo SDK

Equo SDK is an open source SDK, which allows users to write modern GUI applications once, and deploy them across desktop and embedded operating systems without rewriting the source code.

Equo SDK is based on the high-performance open-source [Equo Chromium](https://github.com/equodev/chromium) browser.
